# FinalYearProject

NUIG Final Year project aiming to look at the implementation of machine learning and computer vision in an autonomous vehicle scenario. Specifically, investigating the possibility of identifying car parking spaces, and differentiating between those which are occupied and those which are empty. 

The dataset that I gathered for this project is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/cbuckley/eye-level-parking-lot
